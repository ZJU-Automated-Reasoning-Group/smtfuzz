## smtfuzz: A random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas



SMT solvers are automated tools that can determine the satisfiability of logical formulas in various theories, including arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, and more.
smtfuzz is a random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas. It is designed to help users generate test cases for SMT solvers and explore various SMT-LIB2 features.

## Installation

To install a stable version of smtfuzz:
~~~~
pip3 install smtfuzz
~~~~

Install from source
~~~~
pip install -e .
~~~~

## Usage

After installing the package, you can type
~~~~
smtfuzz
~~~~
And you will see an SMT-LIB2 formula on the screen.

For more advanced options, please use the `-h` flag to display the help menu. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of options to generate a wide variety of SMT-LIB2 formulas for testing purposes.
