## smtfuzz: A random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas



SMT solvers are automated tools that can decide the satisfiability of logical formulas in a variety of theories, including arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, and more.
smtfuzz is a random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas. It is designed to help users generate test cases for SMT solvers and explore various SMT-LIB2 features.

## Installation

To install a stable version of smtfuzz:
~~~~
pip3 install smtfuzz
~~~~

## Usage
After installing the package, you can just type
~~~~
`smtfuzz`
~~~~~
and you will see an SMT-LIB2 formula in the screen.

For more advanced options, please use the `-h` flag to display the help menu.
Feel free to experiment with different combinations of options to generate a wide variety of SMT-LIB2 formulas for testing purposes.
