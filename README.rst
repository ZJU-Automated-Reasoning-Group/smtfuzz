smtfuzz: A random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas
====================================================

smtfuzz is a random generator for SMT-LIB2 formulas. It is designed to help users generate test cases for SMT solvers and explore various SMT-LIB2 features.


After installing this package: Type `smtfuzz`, and you will see an SMT-LIB2 formula in the screen.


For more advanced options, please use the `-h` flag to display the help menu.
Feel free to experiment with different combinations of options to generate a wide variety of SMT-LIB2 formulas for testing purposes.
