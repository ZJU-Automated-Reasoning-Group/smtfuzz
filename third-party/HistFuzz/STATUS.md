We would like to apply for the Reusable badge and the Artifacts Available badge. We believe that the artifact deserves the badges for the following reasons.

* We carefully document the artifact about the tools used in our paper and the code about $\mathrm{HistFuzz}$. More details can be found [here](README.md).
* We provide a Docker Image in the artifact. After entering the container, it's covenient to verify and validate our work by using the provided scripts. We provide the source code in the artifact for manul installation as well.
* We place the artifact on a publicly accessible archival repository (this repo).
